Text: Silvers Asian Surge: Shanghai Momentum, SHFE Bulls & Aiming Beyond $41 Huan Koh July 7, 2025 6:31 am July‚Äôs first week is unfolding like a chapter from silver‚Äôs rebound playbook‚Äîwith vault inflows, options dynamics, and Chinese trader conviction joining forces to shift the narrative. And at every turn, data from Shanghai is outpacing the noise, offering context that Western markets haven‚Äôt priced in yet. As always, Hugo Pascal provides the framework to interpret these moves‚Äîat once structural, opportunistic, and rare. üîπ Hedge Funds of the East: SHFE Traders Go All-In The headline shift came on July 4: Chinese traders on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) aggressively rolled their silver bullish bets deeper and longer. With the most active call strikes at ¬•9,500 per kg, targeting what amounts to $41.25/oz COMEX equivalent, participation surged. The put/call volume ratio climbed to 0.69, the Put/Call Open Interest ratio sits at 0.97, and fresh interest at the ¬•9,000 strike suggests a consensus forming around a $39 breakout. ‚ÄúThis is not idle positioning,‚Äù says Pascal. ‚ÄúWhen OI rolls up to higher strike levels, it means players are pricing in asymmetric upside‚Äîbacked by physical allocation, not just chart cues.‚Äù üè¶ Vaults Tell the Tale: 7-Week Silver Inflow Physical silver echoes the speculative tone. On the same day, Shanghai vaults rose for the seventh consecutive week, adding another 44 tonnes‚Äîpushing total vault holdings to 43 million ounces (1,340 tonnes). That brings a staggering 453 tonnes accumulated in just seven weeks‚Äîa visible sign that physical demand is the engine driving this trade. Vaults at the SGE, meanwhile, dropped by 35 tonnes last week, a trend indicative of supply distribution between futures delivery hubs and storage nodes. ‚ÄúVaults are the best footprint we have for near-term delivery,‚Äù Pascal explains. ‚ÄúYou cant commit to strike prices without metal behind you‚Äîthis is proof that sharks are swimming where the physical is strongest.‚Äù üìä Premium Pressure, Technical Tension & Options Setups Silver closed July 3 with a notable 5.35% premium over LBMA, reinforcing what physical inflows suggest: actual supply is tightening while speculative flow builds aggressive call structures. Over on COMEX, the September ‚Äô25 contract shows a tight 68.2% trading band between $36.11‚Äì$37.35, with a 25-delta risk reversal skew of 3.4, signaling a clear preference for out-of-the-money calls. The looming $38/oz call wall becomes a critical technical threshold. ‚ÄúChina is pricing in $40+ risk,‚Äù Pascal said, ‚Äúwhile the rest of the world has its skewer set at $38. If $38 gives way, expect 39, 40, 41 to fall quickly.‚Äù üß© Where This Leaves the Rest of the World Here‚Äôs the layered story: Asian options flow confirms speculative conviction toward higher price targets‚Äîbacked by packed vaults. Premiums across Asia are pointing to tightening supply and accelerating demand. Western markets remain cautious, constrained by narrower premiums and less aggressive positioning. What‚Äôs happening in China should matter globally. Increased vault stocking and bullish OI suggest that a sharp curtain lift‚Äîbull call breakout or physical delivery pressure‚Äîis becoming not just possible, but probable. A $41 trade would shock Western markets, not because it‚Äôs impossible, but because it breaks the anchoring bias kept by tighter Western premiums and structures. üöÄ Action Plan: The Silver Trade You Cant Ignore If you‚Äôre in Singapore‚Äîor anywhere attuned to Asia‚Äôs metals pulse‚Äîthis is the time to act.

This trend not only highlights robust domestic demand in China but also reflects broader shifts in the global gold market toward physical-backed assets.
